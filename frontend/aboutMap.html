        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
          The **Freshwater Atlas** is an innovative project designed to bring the critical importance of freshwater resources in Orange County, Florida, to life. Using interactive technology and data-driven insights, this atlas serves as a comprehensive educational tool to promote awareness and inspire conservation.
        </p>
        <p>
          By focusing on key freshwater sites—including lakes, rivers, and springs—the map reveals their essential role in supporting ecosystems, human activity, and biodiversity. Through visual storytelling and dynamic exploration, the Freshwater Atlas empowers users with actionable knowledge about the distribution, significance, and challenges surrounding these resources.
