        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
          The Freshwater Atlas is an interactive map designed to explore and highlight the vital freshwater resources of Orange County, Florida. This project is a culmination of research, data analysis, and design efforts to create an engaging tool that fosters a deeper understanding of the distribution, importance, and challenges surrounding these essential natural resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a focus on key freshwater sites—including lakes, rivers, and springs—the map serves as a gateway to understanding their role in sustaining local ecosystems and supporting human activity. By providing insights into water quality, conservation efforts, and the interconnected nature of these resources, the atlas aims to empower users with knowledge about the critical importance of preserving these ecosystems.
