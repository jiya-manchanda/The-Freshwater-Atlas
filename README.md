# The Freshwater Atlas 🌊

The **Freshwater Atlas** is an interactive mapping project that highlights the diverse and essential freshwater resources of Orange County, Florida. Designed to be both educational and visually engaging, this tool allows users to explore key freshwater sites, understand their ecological significance, and appreciate the challenges involved in preserving these natural resources. By integrating detailed data and intuitive design, the project aims to raise awareness and foster action toward conservation.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Freshwater resources—such as lakes, rivers, and springs—are the lifeblood of ecosystems and human activities. However, these resources face numerous threats, including pollution, overuse, and habitat degradation. The Freshwater Atlas seeks to address these issues by providing a platform where users can:

- **Explore**: Navigate an interactive map featuring key freshwater bodies in Orange County.
- **Learn**: Gain insights into water quality, conservation efforts, wildlife habitats, and the role of freshwater in sustaining life.
- **Act**: Understand the impact of human activities and the importance of restoration initiatives.

### Why This Project Matters

Freshwater resources are vital not only for drinking water but also for agriculture, recreation, and supporting biodiversity. However, these resources are finite and vulnerable to overexploitation. By presenting data in an accessible format, the Freshwater Atlas empowers users—from students and researchers to local residents—to:

- Recognize the interconnectedness of freshwater ecosystems.
- Understand the critical importance of sustainable water management.
- Take informed steps toward conservation and advocacy.
