## 🌟 Project Overview

Freshwater resources—such as lakes, rivers, and springs—are the lifeblood of ecosystems and human activities. However, these resources face numerous threats, including pollution, overuse, and habitat degradation. The Freshwater Atlas seeks to address these issues by providing a platform where users can:

- **Explore:** Navigate an interactive map featuring key freshwater bodies in Orange County.
- **Learn:** Gain insights into water quality, conservation efforts, wildlife habitats, and the role of freshwater in sustaining life.
- **Act:** Understand the impact of human activities and the importance of restoration initiatives.

## 🌍 Why This Project Matters

Freshwater resources are vital not only for drinking water but also for agriculture, recreation, and supporting biodiversity. However, these resources are finite and vulnerable to overexploitation. By presenting data in an accessible format, the Freshwater Atlas empowers users—from students and researchers to local residents—to:

- Recognize the interconnectedness of freshwater ecosystems.
- Understand the critical importance of sustainable water management.
- Take informed steps toward conservation and advocacy.

## 🎨 Design Process

### Initial Vision and Wireframes
Our original design included:
- A **homepage** introducing the website and the team.
- A **map page** with a dynamic, interactive map and a sidebar for filtering lakes, rivers, and springs.

### Key Design Changes
1. **About Map Page:** Added a dedicated page to provide insights into the map’s purpose, interactive layers, and real-world implications like water quality data and conservation efforts.
2. **Interactive Map Filter Redesign:** Replaced the fixed sidebar with a simplified design, allowing users to click directly on map pins to learn about specific resources. This improved usability and engagement.
